# Feature Roadmap

## You are here.

This project is an initiative designed to raise computer, programming, and math literacy. Our goal is to make learning accessible and interactive, allowing users to download the code, run the API on their local machine, and begin their educational journey through various learning endpoints.

This API is an open-source project, inviting programmers and educators worldwide to contribute, enriching the content and enhancing the user experience. We believe in the power of community and the value of shared knowledge. With your help, we can make a significant impact, helping individuals worldwide to boost their literacy in these critical fields.

This feature plan outlines the future of this API - the features we aim to develop and the improvements we strive to make. It serves as a roadmap, guiding our journey as we work towards creating a dynamic and comprehensive educational tool. We encourage you to join us on this exciting journey of creation and learning.

## Next stop.

### 1. Interactive Learning

The Interactive Learning feature aims to make learning engaging and fun. Instead of passively consuming information, users will be able to interact with the content, answering questions, solving problems, and building projects. This active engagement helps to reinforce learning, making the information more memorable and the learning process more enjoyable. We believe that by making learning interactive, we can help users stay motivated and engaged, increasing their chances of success.

### 2. Progress Tracking

Progress Tracking is all about giving users a clear view of their learning journey. This feature allows users to see what they've learned, what they're currently learning, and what's coming next. By providing insights into their progress, we aim to keep users motivated and focused. Users will be able to see their improvements over time, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and plan their learning journey more effectively.

### 3. Search Functionality

Search Functionality is a critical feature that will allow users to easily find the content they're looking for. Whether they want to learn a specific topic, revisit a previously learned concept, or explore new areas, the search functionality will guide them to the right place. This feature will support various search parameters, ensuring that users can navigate the content of the API with ease.

### 4. API Versioning

API Versioning is a feature that ensures the API can evolve and improve without disrupting the learning experience of current users. By maintaining different versions of the API, we can introduce new features, update content, and fix bugs, all while ensuring that existing users can continue their learning uninterrupted. This feature provides the flexibility to grow and adapt, meeting the changing needs of our users and the educational landscape.

### 5. Error Handling and Testing

Error Handling and Testing is a feature that ensures the reliability and stability of the API. By implementing robust error handling, we can provide clear and useful feedback when things go wrong, helping users to understand and resolve issues. Additionally, comprehensive testing ensures that all features work as expected, providing a smooth and consistent learning experience. This feature is about building trust with our users, assuring them that they can rely on our API for their learning journey.

### 6. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are critical for personalizing the learning experience and protecting user data. Authentication verifies the identity of the user, allowing for personalized progress tracking and content recommendation. Authorization ensures that users can only access data and perform actions that they are permitted to, protecting the integrity of the system and the privacy of user data. This feature is about providing a safe, secure, and personalized learning environment for all our users.
