# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the API! This document will provide you with some guidelines to ensure smooth and effective collaboration.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this code repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to propose changes without affecting the original project.

2. **Clone the Repository:** After forking, clone the repository to your local machine to start making changes.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch:** Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your fork's main branch clean and makes it easier to integrate your changes later.

2. **Make Small, Focused Commits:** Small, focused commits are easier to review and understand. Each commit should only contain changes related to a single issue or feature.

3. **Write Good Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages that explain what changes were made and why.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Push Your Changes:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

2. **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your fork to the this repository's `main` branch. Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes.

3. **Address Review Feedback:** If your pull request receives feedback, make the necessary changes and push them to your fork.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our Code of Conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to email coming soon.

Remember, the goal is to create a friendly and collaborative environment where everyone feels welcome to contribute. Thank you for your contribution and for making the API better!

## Common Questions

### 1. How do I fork this code?

And what is Forking, anyway? A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.

Here's how to fork a repository on GitHub:

1.  Go to the GitHub page for the repository you want to fork (you are currently here).
2.  Click on the button that says "Fork" at the top right of the page.
3.  Choose where you want to fork the repository.
4.  GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account.

After forking, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git`

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with the name of the repository you've forked. This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine that you can modify.
